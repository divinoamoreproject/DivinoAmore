    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p class="intro-lead">
      <strong>Divino Amore</strong> is a journey of faith and art born from the desire 
      to bring the Gospel into the world through dance, art, and solidarity.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-lead">
      We are not just a group of dancers: we are people who try to place 
      our gifts in God's hands so they may become service, listening, 
      and light for those who watch.
    </p>

        <h2>The Heart of the Project</h2>
        <p>
          The project is led by <strong>Simone Giovanni Messina</strong>, who deeply felt 
          the call to unite his passion for dance with the Word of God.  
          Around this calling, dancers came together with the same desire: 
          to proclaim Love with the body, presence, and care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone who joins this journey is not “just a part of choreography”  
          — but a story, a face, a life that is welcomed and cherished.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that art can become prayer, that dance can become an embrace 
          for those who feel distant, and that beauty is not a luxury 
          — but a concrete way to speak about God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Divino Amore wants to be a sign of trust:  
          trust in God who guides each step,  
          and trust in the human heart — able to rise again, heal, and begin anew.
        </p>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>
        Our rehearsals are not just technical practice: they are moments of listening, 
        prayer, reflection, and community. Every movement is linked to meaning, 
        every artistic choice to a message.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want every person who meets us to feel welcomed — never judged —  
        and perhaps carry home a seed of peace, consolation, or hope.
