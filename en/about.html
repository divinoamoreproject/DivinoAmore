          <h2>Who we are</h2>
          <p>
            We are not just a group of dancers: we are people who want to place
            their talent into God’s hands so that it may become service, listening
            and light for those who are watching.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each person who joins this path becomes part of a choreography,
            but also part of a story, a life that is welcomed and cherished.

          <h2>The heart of the project</h2>
          <p>
            The project is led by <strong>Simone Giovanni Messina</strong>, who felt deep inside
            the desire to unite his passion for God with his artistic calling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around him a group of dancers and collaborators gathered: people
            who share the same desire to announce the Gospel through beauty,
            creativity and concrete love for those in need.

        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
          Through performances, outreach and gestures of solidarity, Divino Amore
          wants to remind every person that they are loved and that their story
          is precious. We carry this message into parishes, theatres, squares and
          wherever there is a heart willing to listen.
